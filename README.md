> **COMPARISON IS THE THIEF OF JOY**

## Logistical

• Hours of communication: Open 

• Communication platforms: Slack, phone, REMO 

• Breaks: once an hour 

• Fall behind plan: Don’t worry, talk to each other, ask a TA for help and see if we can fit in an extra hour or stay later one day.

• How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend? Slack

• What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard? Do a round table during our morning and EOD stand-ups. 

• How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
 Make sure everyone speaks up about where they are mentally and maintain positivity. Approach conflict with curiosity instead of animosity

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development: 

• Maintain open communication, hold morning and EOD stand-ups, constantly share screens (driver/navigator) on where we get stuck. Hold an “where are we at” on our progress once every 1-2 hours before breaks.


### Conflict Resolution

•What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Talk it out, take a break! If it gets too crazy, get a teacher or TA for an outside opinion 

• What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing: 

We are adults, talk it out. Raise concern, ask questions, make sure we understand our given tasks. 

• What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute: 

Same answer to previous question. 

• How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level: 

Ask for help, do mental health checks to make sure we understand the task fully. 

•How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful? 

If we can’t come up with a unanimous resolution within 15 minutes then we will get a third party opinion

### Work Plan

• How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

Take things step by step, talk about who would be best suited for that portion of the project. We will have open communication to find out when the projects are done. 

• What project management tool will be used? We will be using Trello
